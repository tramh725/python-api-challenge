# python-api-challenge

In this week challenge, I used all the knowledge I have learned from Hugo and applied on to this assignment. That being using API, as well as linear regression, specifically the function and how to plot it. 
I used my new found knowledge to compute the windspeed of the city, as well as how cloudy and humid it is.
